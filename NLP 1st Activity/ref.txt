It helps me to be mature because I experience how hard to work just to have a good are quality education
"it helps me a lot especially the sanction, I pay for from being a responsible student through wearing ID inside the school and be a role model among students here in TIP"
"I was shaken to my very core, that this every decision, I will make mean so much to me and I need to be more mature"
This will help me especially in my future career and family
You will become a critical thinker and always make a wise decision
Because if we can obtain teh rules we can practice to become more responsible
I have learned lots from my mistake not to do that anymore
Every mistake is a lesson and that lesson will help me to be a matured and responsible person
